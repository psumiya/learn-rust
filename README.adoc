= Learning Rust

== Pre-requisite

* Install Rust

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

* Compile

Use a script at the root of the project, passing in the rust file name.

`./rustc.sh rust-by-example/primitives/literals.rs`

This will generate an executable with the same name as the rust file name, in the `bin` directory.

This can now be executed as `bin/literals`.
