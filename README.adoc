= Rust By Example

Examples From RBE, https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html[Rust By Example]

== Pre-requisite

* Install Rust

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

== Running an example

* Each example is accompanied by a binary (an executable file).
* To run the `hello` example, type `hello/hello` at the root of this project.

== Updating an example

* Navigate to the directory of an example, `cd hello`
* Edit the corresponding rust file. For example, edit `hello.rs`
* Regenerate the binary using rust compiler. `rustc hello.rs`. This will re-generate the `hello` binary.
* Run the binary, `./hello`
